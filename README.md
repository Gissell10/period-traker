Cycle tracker is a website that helps women for monitoring their menstrual cycle and helping to predict periods. It also allows users to record additional information, such as symptoms that occured in a selected day and period flow.

After sign up, the user is redirected to the "About you" page, where they insert useful information that will be used to predict future periods. Users also has access to your 'one-year' cycle forecast.
